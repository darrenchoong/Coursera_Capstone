Introduction/Business Problem
- I am looking to set up a new Italian restaurant in Toronto in a neighborhood that has the least number of Italian restaurants, so as to maximise my chance of success.

Data
- I will be using the Foursquare location data to analyze the number of Italian restaurants in each neighborhood
